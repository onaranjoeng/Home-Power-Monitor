==== SERVER IS GOOD TO GO START CREATING YOUR WEBSITE!! ===


=== COMMON PROBLEMS / EXTRA STEPS TAKEN TO SOLVE THEM ===

--- Find out which program uses the serial at the same timeport use the command below---
--- Usually get error "permission denied to /dev/ttyAMA0" thsi should do it ---
sudo fuser -v /dev/ttyAMA0
To kill it do: sudo kill 605 (number changes) 

--- Error above was implemented to the serial_daemon_service.py code!!!!!!!! ---
--- Now it automatically kills it as soon as the raspberry turns on ----


--- Error with database stopping due to start/stop daemon button ---
--- Daemon stopped reading current data when user switched between pages ---
--- Therefore a service was made to run in the back at all times ---

---- First lets create the service (if not create it with nano filename.service)----
This will be under: cd /etc/systemd/system/

THIS IS THE CODE for serial_daemon.service!!!!

[Unit]
Description=Serial Daemon Service

[Service]
ExecStart=sudo -u www-data python3 /var/www/html/serial_daemon_service.py
User=www-data
Group=www-data
Restart=always


[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
// end of code

--- Important: www-data is automatically created by apache2 as the username ---

Useful terminal lines(can be used from anywhere):
Enable the Service:
sudo systemctl enable serial_daemon.service
Start the service: 
sudo systemctl start serial_daemon.service
Stop the service: 
sudo systemctl Stop serial_daemon.service
Check if system is running: 
systemctl is-active serial_daemon.service


---- CONFIGURE sudo visudo (just type that into terminal) ---
--- Add this to the end of the code ---
--- Monitor is my raspberry username (yours will be different so change that) ---
--- root or pi is the default user(admin) ---
